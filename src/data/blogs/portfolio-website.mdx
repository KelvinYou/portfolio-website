title: Why I Built My Portfolio Website
description: As a software engineer, I’ve always believed in the power of a strong digital presence. While resumes and LinkedIn profiles are essential, they often fall short of providing a holistic view of one’s capabilities, personality, and journey. That’s why I decided to create my own portfolio website—a dedicated space that truly represents me and my work

#### 1. **Showcasing My Projects**
A portfolio website is the perfect platform to highlight the projects I’ve worked on. It allows me to go beyond bullet points and screenshots, providing detailed insights into the technologies used, the challenges faced, and the solutions I developed. For potential collaborators or employers, this level of transparency is invaluable.

#### 2. **Sharing My Experiences**
Working with Beyondsoft Malaysia and being outsourced to Tencent was a defining chapter in my career. Through my portfolio, I can share stories about these experiences—what I learned, the impact I made, and how these roles shaped me as an engineer.

#### 3. **A Hub for My Blog**
I’ve always wanted to blog about my journey, challenges, and lessons learned. My portfolio doubles as a blogging platform where I can connect with the developer community, share my insights, and hopefully inspire others.

#### 4. **Making My Resume Interactive**
Static resumes are great, but they can’t fully capture my journey. On my website, my resume comes to life with links to projects, detailed timelines, and sections dedicated to skills and certifications.

#### 5. **Reflecting My Personality**
Every detail of my portfolio—its design, animations, and content—is a reflection of my personality. As someone who enjoys crafting intuitive and engaging user experiences, my website serves as a live demo of my front-end skills and creativity.

#### 6. **Building Credibility**
In today’s competitive tech industry, having a portfolio demonstrates initiative, professionalism, and a commitment to personal growth. It’s not just a collection of achievements; it’s proof of my dedication to my craft.

#### 7. **Connecting with Opportunities**
Finally, my portfolio acts as a digital business card. Whether it’s recruiters, potential clients, or fellow developers, anyone visiting my site can easily learn about me, browse my work, and get in touch.

#### Conclusion
Creating my portfolio website has been a rewarding experience—not just as a project but as a way to tell my story. It’s more than just a website; it’s a reflection of my journey, aspirations, and identity as a software engineer.
